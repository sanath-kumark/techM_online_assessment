Hello, this is an application to trigger a webhook upon creating or updating a product.

This application also has a basic UI to perform CRUD operations.

We can run this application on ruby environment. Routing to localhost will land in a home page.

We can create Products and add ThirdPartyApiEndpoints into the database.

Instructions to run the application:
1. bundle install
2. rails db:migrate

Thanks.
